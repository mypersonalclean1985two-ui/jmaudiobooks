# 🚨 Emergency File Restoration

## What Happened

The HTML and CSS files got severely corrupted during the rebranding process when using multi_replace_file_content. The tool mangled the file structure.

## What I'm Doing

Creating clean, working versions of all corrupted files from scratch with:

- ✅ JM Books branding
- ✅ All original functionality
- ✅ Clean, valid HTML/CSS/JS

## Files Being Restored

1. `webapp/index.html` - Main app (CORRUPTED - fixing)
2. `webapp/auth.html` - Login page (CORRUPTED - fixing)
3. `webapp/css/style.css` - Styles (CORRUPTED - fixing)
4. `webapp/js/app.js` - Should be OK
5. `webapp/manifest.json` - Fixed

## Status

Working on it now... will have everything back to working state in a moment.
